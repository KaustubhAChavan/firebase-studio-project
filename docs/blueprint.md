## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) for a sense of security and sophistication.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0F8FF). It offers a clean backdrop without being stark.
- Accent color: Electric Violet (#8F00FF). Use for interactive elements to guide user attention.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif. It has a modern, objective, neutral look and is suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, consistent icons from a set like Material Design Icons for form elements, password visibility, and password strength.
- Center the login form on the page for a balanced look, using a card layout with rounded corners and subtle shadows to separate it from the background.
- Implement subtle animations on input focus and validation to provide visual feedback without being intrusive.
